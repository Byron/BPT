The following environment varibles need to be setup to be able to build the project on windows.
On linux, most of them will have a sane default, unless specified differently.

B_PATH_TMP 
----------
The path containing intermediate build files

B_[RELEASE|DEBUG]_OUTPUT_PATH
--------------------------
The path to which to copy the final built files or the debug versions respectively

B_SDK_MAYA ( to be set on linux and windows )
------------------------------------
Specifies a folder containing all maya sdk's in a directory structur similar to the following:
${B_SDK_MAYA}/<maya version>/<os bits
                                     /lib
                                     /include
 i.e. ${B_SDK_MAYA}/2008/64 
Please note that the build system will assume the lib folders are compatible to your current operating system.
On windows, these must be windows libraries, on linux the respective linux libraries.
NOTE: As Autodesk Maya is no free software, everyone who wants to build BPT needs to provide the Maya SDK by himself.
