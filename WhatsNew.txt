
BEFORE INSTALLING THE NEW VERSION:
PLEASE NOTE: 	Before installing the new version, make sure to delete the history on meshes you are going to work on 
		 with the new version. This is because the new version may be incompatible with the previous one,
		 and the scene fails to load due to node incompatibilities.


GENERAL LIMITATIONs SO FAR:
-------------------------------
- it will only keep one UVSet - I simply cannot write my modified UVSets back to the mesh :(.
- perPolygon shader assignments will be lost - Maya , for some reason doesn't allow me to get and save the shadingSets :((. I think it has to do with
	the fact, that DGStuff has to be evaluated to do that, but this doesn`t work while inside the compute method of a node ... .
- No support for holed polygons or nGons that contain a certain vtxID at least twice - the API doesn`t allow me to create such polygons





BETA 1.0 RV:		Release Date: 20-05-2006	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 	First version which runs on Maya 7 and above.  I will take what I have, clean it and prepare a proper release.


ALPHA 6.6:			Release Date: 09-14-2004	Valid for: no expiration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Note:
	Due to my work at BFC, and my jobs for other companies, I am currently not able to release new versions
	of BPT every 45 days. This is why this version will not expire since this does not make sense anymore.

#Added:
-	The sceneStepAnnotations are now saved in the preview file and will be shown in the help line if you hover over an 
	annotated scene step file.

#Bugfixes:
-	The STT falloff visualization sometimes disapeared, which has been fixed

-	If the period of autobackup was set below 1, it was clipped to zero which led to a "permanent" autobackup.

- 	The visualization of the falloffs in general now looks better due to the use of alphablending

-	Added the definition of pathes for the "Save Step ..." function

-	Improved the recognition of backup files

-	Restore file now uses a save way to overwrite the original file, so there won`t be dataloss if the process
	is aborted during writing. This is because he now writes a temporary file first, and once this 
	is completed successfully, it will rename it the name of the file to be restored after deleting that file.

- 	The "Byronimo.dll: Could not find font" error will not show up anymore ( this is because the BPT font is 
	now included in the dll ).

-	added a custom path attribute for scene steps, so you can decide yourself where to put the files

-	added additional space usage Information in "clear..." option menu

-	You can now limit the space to be used by the backup system.



--	Previews: You can enable the preview feature for incremental saves, autobackup and scene steps. This allows the 
	quick preview of scenes, no matter how large they are. If a preview is available for a scene file, you 
	will see an optionbox next to the filename in the backupfiles submenu, which will show the preview if you click on it.
	Hit the "Restore UI" item to restore your own layout.


-	BackupSystem

	Since everything takes longer than I expected, I decided to implement an autobackup to help you deal
	with not too stable alphas.
	As done by the incremental save functionality , it creates a backup of your scene file.
	Therefore your scene will be saved after a certain period of time, and then copied to a backupfolder, uniquely
	named.
	Autobackup in combination with incremental save will be your protection 
	from data loss of any kind. I also implemented incremental save with the API which allows it to be even better.
	All the file`s backups can be accessed directly through the Maya UI, and can restored or cleared.
	It is up to you whether you whish to open a backuped scene and then restore it
	with a single hit on a button, or wheter you want to get the most recent backupped version
	of the current scene.
	
	
	- Feature Overview

	#	Optionally configure filepath and filename for the backup if you prefer consistent filenaming

	#	It will save only if nessecary - if you do not do anything, there won`t be an autosave

	#	The timer will be reset after a manual save, this will be handy for large scenes and
		prevent unnessecary saves.
	
	# 	Associate the autobackup functionality with the scene, so you don`t have to set it up
		manually all the time.

	# 	Backup is now a part of the file menu, which allows you to browse your backups, and 
		restore them as needed.

	#	Save annotated step files, managed by the plugin


	The new functionality is encapsulated in the
	
	BGlobals
	
	MEL Command.

	The flags can all be found in the scripts I supply, and are not relevant to the user since
	everything can be accessed through the UI.

	The backup system will stay in BPT as long as it in alpha and beta state.


	@RELEASE NOTES
		If you use "Save Step..." and enter an annotation, then browse to another file
		and return to the original file afterwards, you will see an annotation node which
		was not there before.

		This is, because it actually has been saved with your scene, and deleted afterwards, 
		but at save time, it of course has still been there.

		Workaround:
			Save your scene after you saved a step.



ALPHA 6.5 V2:			Release Date: 07-30-2004	Valid for: 45 Days
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: 	This compile does not add additional functionality, but only resets the timer to give additional
	45 days.

	This was nessecary since my work on the Byronimoengine was unexpected in regards to it`s extend.
	
	Especially the font system takes some time, but it will be worth it :) !

	In future, BPT and other plugins of mine will be able to create interfaces and ways of interaction
	that would never be possible with MEL or the default Maya stuff, so the overall workflow will be
	improved.
	
Remarks:
	You cannot jump back to previous versions which are able to timeout after you started this version
	at least once.
	This is because there is a versioncontrol which prohibits older versions to run, even if they didn`t
	timeout yet.


ALPHA 6.5:			Release Date: 06-16-2004	Valid for: 45 Days
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-	New Design:				BPT is now dependent on my new support Platform Byronimo.dll . It has to be located in the 
			Maya/bin 
						directory and contains the new UIInterface, which is disabled in this point release.

-	Expiration: 
	This is the first version which is limited in use - it will expire in 45 days.
	Once this version has expired, some restrictions apply:

	- The softTransformationTool won`t be available. A script error will occour saying the tool was not found. This is because it does not exist
	  anymore then.

	- The ByronsPolyTools command which actually triggers all the functions won`t work
	
	- Scenes with BPT Nodes in it will load properly.

	This is meant to impose some sort of deadline to me because I will have to supply the next version in quite exactly 45 days



-	Note: Since the SoftTransformationTool was supposed to be revised next, one change has been already made: The visualization has been improved and
	is conform to the one of the softTransformationEngine now, althoug still the old node is in use.



- 	New SofttransformationEngine (STE):	I completely redesigned evrerything that has to do with softTransformation. All BPT Nodes now have a common
						softTransformation interface.
						The visualization is not dependent on vertex colors anymore, but pure openGl, so it looks better, isfaster
						an safer since there is no chance of VtxColors retaining on the mesh.

						About STE:
							STE is based on the STEngine which is located on the Node, either BPTNode or insertVtxNode.


						STE
						Attributes:	
							showWeights: 	Activates or deactivates the graphical display.
								Remarks: 	If the object is selected, you can click the BPT Nodes in the channelbox
										to see its influence.
										If the object is highlighted, the topmost BPTNode will always visualize
										the STWeights, even if the BPTNode is not selected in the channelbox.
										You can click any other BPTNode in the channelbox to see its STWeights 
										additionally.
							
							Distance: 	The radius of influence for the softSelection.

							EdgeDistance: 	The number of edges the softSelection will be based on.
									Remarks: If this parameter is not equal to 0, the distance parameter
									will be ignored, and the EdgeDistance parameter will be used instead.

							push:		Push the affected vertices along the normals.

							pushRelativeToFaceSize: The bigger the size of the underlying face, the stronger the push will be.

							falloffType:	Defines the curve which resamples the weights, which are linear initially.
									Values are: Linear, Smooth, Spike, Dome


							MaximumWeights:	Determines the maximum count of parent vertices that contribute to the influence
									of that vertex. It can be compared to the number of joints that influence the 
									vertex of a skin.
									The higher the value, the smoother the deformation.

																	
							Smoothen:	The higher this value, the smoother the look of the deformation will be.

							matrix:		Connect a transformationMatrix to this attribute and use it at a cluster.
									This will be automated in the next alpha.

							meshMatrix:	Matrix to control the drawing of the weights. This is nessecary since 
									the softTransformationEngine is a DG Node, but needs to draw in the viewport, 
									so that this matrix determines the transformation of the drawing.
								

							UseMatrixRotation:	If true, then the matrix rotation will be used, which will give a better 
										look.
							
							

	
							

-	BPT_insertVtxNode:		I attached the softTransformationEngine to it, so it will have the same softTransformation capabilities as the 
					BPT Node (i.e. BPT_connect)


-	NEW NODE:
	Byronimo			This node is a helper that will drive the drawings of the softTransformationWeights in the viewport. Only one node
					may exist per scene and it will be created automatically if needed.
					You *can* delete it, but if you do so, BPT won`t be able to draw into the viewport anymore at all.
					This is why deleting that node is *not recommended*.


-	BugFix#1:	Internal failure if you applied BPT on a deformed object with a multiMesh attribute upstream of the mesh itsself, 
			as a cluster for example. This will work now.


-	BugFix#2:	Due to the new softTransformationEngine and some other changes, loading a mesh with BPT History can now be considered safe
			with all combinations of parameters ( tweak, slide and whatever ).



ALPHA 6:			Release Date:
--------------------------------------------------

-	Preferences:	The former preferences style got too cluttered with the time, so I decided to integrate it into the default Maya preferences.
			I do that in a way that does not need to overwrite the originial files - it integrates the BPT prefs on the fly :).

-	KeepUVs/Normals: 	These options have been removed - and are always on now. Since I remove flags from time to time, please do only use
				dynamic hotkeys (those which use the eval(generateCmdString( ... ) style), so you won`t need to change the hotkeys.
				
			GENERAL INFO: The only thing kept by BPT is the "hard" status of edges. Real individual normals will therefore be lost.
			

-	(Solid)Chamfer:	The Bevel algos have been revised and are supposed to give much better results. 
			Beveling on BorderEdges shouldn`t be a prolem anymore, and complex constellations of "endEdges" will work properly too now.
			Besides that, they will keep the UVs.
			On complicated Bevels, they may be more or less intense distortions.
			But I still have Ideas on how to improve the results :), so I will do soon.

-	Connect Bug: 	I fixed a cnnect bug that occoured with UVs on borderedges and caused a crash.

-	More safety:	Every node is now protected in some way: Severe Errors will be cought, and the user will be informed about that (including the
			suggestion to write a bug report and/or to undo and save the work.
			This doesn`t seem to work on LINUX yet.

-	ProgressBar:	Tweakprocessing can take some time, especially on large Meshes. This is why I formerly printed progressMessages into 
			the outPutWindow, which could cause it to popUp.
			Now, the main maya progress bar will be used instead.


-	BugFix #1:	If you selected a vertex, then an edge, and then a vertex again and applied a connect, only th first two components
			would have been used for the split. 
			This will work now.


-NOTES:
	-->Algo for determining the UVs not final yet so UV Positions are not 100% correct
	-->Will probably create too many UVs (for example creates two UVs even though they have the same position)
	-->On undo, the newly created UVs will stay in the meshShape, although unused then.

SMART SPLIT: I found out that I introduced a lot of new bugs when I tried to fix old ones, so SmartSplit tends to leave create Vertices
		 that are not connected to adjecent faces.
		Since SmartSplit is the first splitalgo I ever wrote, there is much I can do better now, so I will give it a rewrite as soon as possible
		


LINUX: This is the first BPT version which runs on Linux too. Its not really tested. One thing I found out: IMPORTANT:

	CHAMFER IS STILL WIP, AND NOT READY AT ALL. 
	IF YOU USE IT, IT WILL PROBABLY CRASH.
	IN WINDOWS; THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM SINCE THE ERROR WILL BE COUGHT, BUT
	IN LINUX; WHOLE MAYA CRASHES WITH BPT.
	
	I WILL FIND OUT WHY THIS HAPPENS AND FIX IT, BUT UNTIL THEN:

	PLEASE DO NOT USE THE CHAMFER (SOLID CHAMFER WORKS)



ALPHA 5:
------------------------

- New Functionality: 	edgebased smart split, or connect :). It is basically an BPT_insertVtx node which can, as the name implies, 
			insert vertices into edges. See the "Split" Submenu for some buttons to click on.

			- Parameters that are new:
				*count: 		how many vertices should be inserted into the edge?
				*spin:			Only show an effect if AutoConnect is on and allows you to change the connect's result 



- New Connect Algo: 	The aforementioned InsertVtx Node can automatically connect the newly inserted vertices using this new connect algo.
			Again, refer to the split submenu.



- Smartsplit: 		formerly it could only connect two vertices sharing one face. It uses the new connect routine now, so the number of vertices
			to connect per face do not play a role.



- New NodeNames: 	BPT uses exactly two nodes: The ByronsPolyToolsNode and the BPT_InsertVertex Node. Though every node can have several modes
			(  {Solid}Chamfer, SMC, SmartSplit respectively InsertVertices oder Connect ), the node names will now be named as their mode implies.
			This way you see what you did if you watch your stack, instead of having dozens of BPTNodes :).



- {Solid}Chamfer: 	I finally got the idea on how to get the new faces direction right, so there is no need for these extra MayaNodes on the stack
			once you create a bevel. This makes sliding faster, because there is no extra history that has to be evaluated.


- New (possible) workflow: 	In the preferences you may activate the: "SmartSplit: Distuingish Component Types" option. 
				If you select edges now and hit smartSplit, it will actually create a ConnectNode for you. This means, that a 
				smartSplit will be available only with faceSelections


- New Option: "Connect: CenterEdges" - Due to the nature of the connect, a slidevalue of 1 refers to a centered edge (instead of 0.5 with smartSplit).
			This option simply overrides the slideValue for the smartSplit and replaces it with one, so you get expected results if
			you use connect.


- Another new (possible) workflow: 	(if "SmartSplit: Distuingish Component Types" is set true) Select an edge (or edges) AND a vertex (or vertices)
					and hit smartSplit to insert a vtx into the edge and connect the new vertex(ices) to the vertex(ices)
					you selected. Change the spin or count afterwards to switch between different results.

					If the aforementioned flag is not set, you have to explicitly invoke a "connect".


- And there are some other Options in the "Split" Menu which are selfexplaining as I think :)




ALPHA 4:
------------------------

- Normals should work now for smartSplit

- UVs have a great performance improvement now - you won't even notice that they are being calculated, even on real big meshes
- fixed some UV bugs



ALPHA 3:
------------------------

SoftTransformation Tool:

- press Ctrl + LMB and drag to change the distance attribute, or press and drag Ctrl + LMB + MMB to change the mask size





Auto Select:

-please take at the preferences - Auto-Select. There you will find options to determine which type of components will be selected after your operation





UVs:

-"Keep UVs" Option (default on) in the preferences: Will work for SmartSplit only at the moment and generate UVs for you, so you won't loose them anymore

Please note: This will only work for the default UVSet, so any extra UVSet will be lost afterwards (internally I calculate UVs for every UVSet, 
but cannot apply them unfortunately )



Normals

-Implemented for SmartSplit, but cannot apply them (therefore you do not have a option for this at the moment).


ALPHA 2:
------------------------
-internal - more or less ;)

ALPHA 1:
------------------------
-internal - more or less ;)
